# Overview
This project was the last front-end project for The Odin Project. A free online coding course that I took at the start of 2022 (before I began my software developer bootcamp). The object of this exercise was to create a fully functioning calculator that could take and perform a variet of function on two inputted numbers.

This was my first attempt at a full project with complext logical code to be executed. Therefore it is a little bit messy, and does not meet best practice standards. However, this was done with no assistance from any instructors and was an excellent exercise in problem solving. I had to refactor the code several times to meet the requirements of the project, and I learned a great deal along the way.
